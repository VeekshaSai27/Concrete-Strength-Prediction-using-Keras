# üèó Concrete Strength Prediction using Keras

This project uses a simple **feed-forward neural network** built with **Keras** to predict the **compressive strength of concrete** based on its ingredients (cement, water, aggregates, etc.).

##  Key Steps in the Workflow

- Load the dataset and split it into features (predictors) and target (strength).
- Normalize the input features for better training performance.
- Build a 3-layer neural network:
  - Input layer: accepts all feature columns.
  - Two hidden layers.
  - Output layer with no activation for regression output.
- Train the model using the **Adam** optimizer and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss function.
- Evaluate by printing sample predictions.

This is a beginner-friendly example of applying deep learning to a real-world regression problem.
